# odin-landing-page

This repo contains my work for the Landing Page project from the Flexbox section of the Odin Project Foundations course.

Given a mockup image of a website format, I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch to create the website.
I used flexbox CSS display paradigm to organize all of the items and all colors and font sizes were used based on the project specification.

With this exercise, I was reminded of how long formatting a website like this could take. I had a pretty good idea of what needed to be done, so I thought I would get it done very quickly, but it does take time to work out all of the kinks. In the end, this exercise took me about 4 hours to complete. I believe it's good to have realistic understanding of how long different parts of a development project might take so that I can plan the different steps of development accordingly.
